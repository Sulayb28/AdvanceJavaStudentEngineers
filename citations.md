### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assistant was used to help set up the initial iteration of the MetaDetect AI Image Detection Service project by providing technical guidance on:

* Refactoring and renaming the base Spring Boot application from **IndividualProject** → **MetaDetect**
* Updating Java package paths to `dev.coms4156.project.metadetect`
* Revising the `pom.xml` to reflect new coordinates (`groupId`, `artifactId`, `version`, `name`) and to add Checkstyle, PMD, and JaCoCo (≥ 55 % coverage)
* Adjusting `application.properties` to use `spring.application.name=metadetect-service` and `spring.application.version=0.1.0`
* Cleaning Git tracking (`.gitignore` fixes and `.idea` untracking)
* Crafting consistent commit messages and PR templates mapped to the Kanban workflow

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

Prompts and questions provided to ChatGPT included:

* “What should my Kanban ticket be called for setting up the skeleton code?”
* “How should I rename my Spring Boot app and packages to MetaDetect?”

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assisted in designing and drafting controller-slice tests for the `/auth/*` endpoints, as well as creating a dedicated Spring Security test configuration to allow unauthenticated access for the proxy tests. It also helped refine the JSON content-type enforcement in the proxy response so the controller tests aligned with expected client behavior.

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

* Requested a controller-level test suite for `AuthController`.
* Noticed 403 and 401 blocking proxy tests → requested correction for security config.
* Asked for `SecurityTestConfig` to disable CSRF and allow passthrough behavior.

* Updated `AuthProxyService.java` (explicit JSON content type)
* Added `SecurityTestConfig.java` for test slice security
* Added `AuthControllerTest.java`, covering success and error paths

---

### **Verification**

Changes were validated by:

* Running `mvn clean test` to ensure all tests passed successfully

### **Commit / Ticket Reference**

* **Commit:** `feat(#9): add ImageRepository and implement ImageService with ownership and service-layer exceptions`
* **Ticket:** `#9 — Implement ImageService core logic`
* **Date:** October 22, 2025
* **Team Member:** Jalen Stephens

---

### **AI Tool Information**

* **Tool Used:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5)
* **Access Method:** ChatGPT Web (.edu academic access)
* **Configuration:** Default model settings
* **Cost:** $0 (no paid API calls)

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI provided guidance and implementation help for creating the `ImageRepository`, wiring it into the `ImageService`, and introducing service-layer exceptions (`NotFoundException`, `ForbiddenException`) to support ownership enforcement and clean error semantics.

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

* Asked how to start on the ImageService ticket.
* Shared existing schema for the `images` table.
* Requested matching repository + service implementation.
* Asked whether service-layer exceptions are standard practice.
* Requested a one-line commit message referencing ticket `#9`.

---

### **Resulting Artifacts**

* `ImageRepository.java` (new)
* `ImageService.java` (updated core logic + ownership enforcement)
* `ForbiddenException.java` (new)
* `NotFoundException.java` (new)

---

### **Verification**

* Build completed successfully using `mvn clean verify`.
* Code reviewed manually to confirm schema alignment and method signatures.
* Successfully wired into the service layer with no startup issues.

### **Commit / Ticket Reference**

* **Commit:** `test(#9): add ImageService unit tests and update pom to run under Java 17`
* **Ticket:** `#9 — Implement ImageService core logic`
* **Date:** October 22, 2025
* **Team Member:** Jalen Stephens

---

### **AI Tool Information**

* **Tool Used:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5)
* **Access Method:** ChatGPT Web (.edu academic access)
* **Configuration:** Default model settings
* **Cost:** $0 (no paid API calls)

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

Assistance was used to design and implement comprehensive branch-coverage unit tests for `ImageService`, including mocking strategies, repository interaction expectations, and handling JDK/Jacoco compatibility issues for coverage instrumentation.

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

* “Can we create unit test now on the code we just added…”
* Debugging JaCoCo crash and version mismatch
* Fixing Mockito inline instrumentation conflict
* Request for one-line commit message referencing #9

---

### **Resulting Artifacts**

* `src/test/java/dev/coms4156/project/metadetect/service/ImageServiceTest.java`
* Updated `pom.xml` (ensuring Java 17 execution for tests/coverage)

---

### **Verification**

* Successfully executed `mvn clean test` under Java 17
* Verified branch coverage logic (success + failure paths)
* Confirmed green test suite and valid JaCoCo run

### **Commit / Ticket Reference**

* **Commit:** `api(#6): wire ImageController to ImageService and update metadata handling`
* **Ticket:** `#6 — Implement ImageController endpoints`
* **Date:** October 22, 2025
* **Team Member:** Jalen Stephens

---

### **AI Tool Information**

* **Tool Used:** OpenAI ChatGPT (GPT-5)
* **Access Method:** ChatGPT Web (.edu academic access)
* **Configuration:** Default model settings
* **Cost:** $0 (no paid API calls)

---

### **Purpose of AI Assistance**

The AI assisted in implementing the HTTP-facing controller layer by wiring `ImageController` to the existing `ImageService`, ensuring correct DTO mappings, handling ownership enforcement, and aligning update endpoints with the final DTO definitions. It also confirmed correct HTTP response shapes and status codes.

---

### **Prompts / Interaction Summary**

* “let’s implement the ticket”
* “here is image controller”
* “here is my user service”
* “we can redo the dtos”
* Compile errors surfaced → AI realigned controller logic with actual DTO structure

---

### **Resulting Artifacts**

* `src/main/java/dev/coms4156/project/metadetect/controller/ImageController.java` (updated)
* Metadata update endpoint corrected to match `UpdateImageRequest` structure (note + labels only)
* Exception → HTTP mapping added (404 / 403)

---

### **Verification**

* Successful Maven compilation after DTO alignment
* Manual inspection of controller flow against schema and service logic
* Local run verified routing and method resolution
